                    <p>I conducted some research alongside the product manager to discover what we are building, despite having a brief given we conducted some research to validate, and have a deeper understanding of the pain points of the users and bridge it with the business goals. The UX phase began with getting to know the users and their behaviors and the research goal was aimed at getting a clear idea of the problem as it directly affects the users, and uncovering their needs and frustrations to better understand how to create a better experience for them. This enabled me to get a better understanding of the pain points of our users and empathize more. Research started with interviews to get some qualitative data and from the data gotten, we decided to work towards an MVP, and from the gotten pain points we needed some quantitative data to identify the most sorted solutions of our target market to properly roll out an MVP</p>

We help businesses reconcile all payments to and from the business and can even link external accounts that the transitions affect the business. Cash payments play a major part in balancing so we give you the ability to register all cash payments made into your business account to serve as a record and the payment can be reconciled as well for a good business accounting system.</p>

And also the understanding of business goals to ensure the business makes a profit has to be placed as another priority hence a lot of calls with stakeholders and the aligning of design and business goals has to be established from the start.</p>
                        <p>I enjoyed this project and I got to realize how we can help people who run businesses if they focus on the business itself they have more time and strategic juice to focus and take their organization to greater heights</p>
