                        <li>Observe if users were able to easily find a particular company they were looking for</li>
                        <li>Observe if users on making a complaint and didn't find the company if they were able to suggest the company to trustbreed</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Both in-person and remote moderated usability tests were conducted. The test included a short brieﬁng and task performance with the Trustbreed. 5 participants took part in the usability test, all participants agreed that the app is uncomplicated and simple to use, including mainly only necessary information and buttons. After collecting the information, I created a rainbow sheet to identify valuable insights.</p>
